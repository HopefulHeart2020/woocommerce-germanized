# [WooCommerce Germanized](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vendidero/woocommerce-germanized.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vendidero/woocommerce-germanized)

WooCommerce Germanized extends WooCommerce to meet german law and adds some german market specific functionality like the delivery to DHL Pick-Up-Stations. Germany has some very specific 
legal requirements in regard to selling products online - that's why a lot of german store owners are aware of expensive warning letters because of formal violations against german law.   

WooCommerce Germanized creates the technical preconditions to operate a legally certain WooCommerce store in Germany. Still the store owner needs to take care of the content (e.g. legal pages such as cancellation, terms etc.).

### WooCommerce for the German Market
After installation the plugin optionally adapts your WooCommerce settings to meet a typical german setup (e.g. price display, tax settings).
Furthermore blank templates for legal pages such as Terms & Conditions or Imprint can be generated automatically. 

**Delivery Times**
Create specific delivery times for your products and variations. Show delivery times on your product page as well as cart and checkout. 
You may even setup a default delivery time which acts as a fallback if no specific delivery time has been set.

**Price Labelling**
Show legally required notices like tax or shipping cost notices on your product pages, loops and checkout.

**Checkboxes**
On your checkout page you may optionally insert multiple checkboxes to let your customer explicitly accept your terms & conditions as well as cancellation conditions. 
Furthermore specific checkboxes for digital/virtual and service products are provided. 

**Email Attachments**
Configure email attachments to make sure your terms & conditions or imprint are attached to your WooCommerce emails (e.g. order confirmation email).

**Unit Prices**
WooCommerce Germanized offers unit prices for your products. You may then easily setup unit-specific prices for your products e.g. 5,00 Euro per 100 ml to inform your customers.
