= Germanized for WooCommerce is certified by Trusted Shops =
Germanized has been approved by Trusted Shops and therefor offers best technical conditions to operate a legally binding WooCommerce Shop in Germany.
Trusted Shops certifies Shops after selected and weighted criteria and has carefully examined our WooCommerce Plugin.
Of course Trusted Shops customers may embed their quality seals or further Trusted Shops Products as genuine Seller and Product Reviews by adapting just a few options within Germanized for WooCommerce.

= Pro: WooCommerce PDF invoices & packing slips =
As a Pro User of Germanized you may automatically or manually create PDF Invoices and Packing Slips for your orders. Adjust your document layout by using the built-in visual document editor.
Either export your documents (CSV, zip) for your tax consultant manually or use our integrations to transmit your documents to your lexoffice or sevDesk account.
Learn more about [PDF Invoices for WooCommerce](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized/features#accounting "WooCommerce PDF Invoices")

Furthermore you may attach legally relevant pages (e.g. Terms & Conditions) as PDF documents to specific WooCommerce emails instead of using plain text.

= Add shipments to WooCommerce orders =
Germanized adds a new abstraction layer to WooCommerce to make it easier for you to send your parcels to your customers. With Germanized you'll be able to generate (multiple) shipments to an order.
You can then manage your shipments and it's statuses independently from your orders. Let your customers receive a notification email as soon as a shipment has been marked as shipped including tracking information from a built-in or manually added shipping provider. Learn more about our [Shipments for WooCommerce](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized/features#shipments "Shipments for WooCommerce") integration and find out how to automate your shipping process.

= Handle returns with ease =
Managing returns can be a time-consuming challenge. By using Germanized you might let your customers create return requests through their customer panel. All you need to do is confirm the request through your return dashboard and your customers will receive an email containing further steps on how to return their product(s).
In case you are using our DHL integration you might as well (automatically) create a label to the return which will be attached to the email sent to the customer.

= Post & DHL Integration =
With the help of our built-in Post & DHL integration you can easily create labels for your shipments and add tracking information to the notification emails. Furthermore you can offer DHL Wunschpaket Services to your customers including shipping to Packstation or choosing a preferred location, day and/or time within the checkout.
You can even let your shipments and labels be generated automatically by Germanized to avoid further manual work. [Learn more](https://vendidero.de/dokumentation/woocommerce-germanized/versanddienstleister "Post & DHL for WooCommerce") about how our Post & DHL integration works.

= Extended One Stop Shop compliance =
With a little help from our [One Stop Shop compliance plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-stop-shop-woocommerce/) bundled within Germanized you'll handle the new EU VAT regulations with ease. Generate new VAT reports for different time frames and let the plugin
observe the delivery threshold automatically to make sure you'll get notified in case you are close to reaching the threshold and need to take action.

= Pro: Premium Support =
Customers of Germanized for WooCommerce Pro enjoy our high-quality support via tickets. Nevertheless we also seek to offer a good plugin support via our WordPress support forum.

* WPML
* WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing
* WooCommerce Role Based Pricing
* WooCommerce Product Bundles

= Tested WooCommerce Themes =

* Flatsome
* Enfold
* Storefront
* Virtue
* Shopkeeper

= Updating Germanized for WooCommerce =

Before updating WooCommerce you should definitely check whether Germanized does already support the newest version.
You may of course Update Germanized for WooCommerce automatically through the WordPess Backend. Please make sure to always backup (at least your database) before updating any theme or plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the documentation? =
[Germanized Documentation](https://vendidero.de/dokumentation/woocommerce-germanized)

= Need help? =

You may ask your questions regarding Germanized for WooCommerce within our free [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-germanized).
Professional help desk support is being offered to [Professional Users](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized "Support for WooCommerce Germanized") only.

= Not every option fits my WooCommerce Theme =

Unfortunately not every Theme does implement WooCommerce in the way it's meant to be or differs from the original structure which leads to layout and/or compatibility
issues. For testing purposes, please activate a default WordPress Theme (such as TwentyX) and see whether the issues persist.

= Using a Pagebuilder? =

In case you are using a Pagebuilder (e.g. Elementor, Divi-Builder) you might want to replace the default [shopmarks](https://vendidero.de/dokument/preisauszeichnungen-anpassen) placed by Germanized with our custom [shortcodes](https://vendidero.de/dokument/preisauszeichnungen-anpassen#pagebuilder).

= Email attachments not showing in WooCommerce order confirmation email =

In most times you have a wrong configuration within your Germanized email settings. The order confirmation email sent to the customer after an order has been made is called "Processing Order". The email called "New Order" is the email
sent to the Administrator which serves as a notification only - so make sure you have "Processing Order" selected within the plugins' settings.

= Want to file a bug or improve Germanized for WooCommerce? =

Bug reports may be filed via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vendidero/woocommerce-germanized).
