Extends WooCommerce to become a legally compliant Shop for German Market. Must Have for every German Shop Owner. Certified by Trusted Shops.

== Description ==

*This description is available in [German](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-germanized/ "WooCommerce Germanized")*

WooCommerce Germanized extends WooCommerce to technically match german legal conditions. The objective of this plugin is to perfectly adapt WooCommerce to meet the special requirements of german market. WC Germanized is being continually developed by an experienced german team - on updates of WooCommerce we will respond quickly by offering compatibility. 

Users of [WooCommerce Germanized Pro](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized "WooCommerce optimized for German Market") benefit from additional features such as PDF Invoices, Model Text Generators for terms and revocation, Premium Support and more!

To fit german requirements even better you may have a look at our [WooCommerce Theme](https://vendidero.de/vendipro "WooCommerce Theme for German Market") specifically developed for the german market: VendiPro.
While developing VendiPro we have specifically considered german design principles. WooCommerce Germanized + VendiPro are a perfect combination for your german WooCommerce Shop.

= Legal Certainty for German Market =
WooCommerce Germanized supports typical german shop functionality: Delivery Times, Base Prices, Shipping Costs and Tax Notices, legally relevant Pages (e.g. Terms, Revocation Page etc.) - even in Emails, Small Business Regulation, Fees for Payment Methods and much more.
Furthermore we have customized the checkout to make your WooCommerce Shop meet the german law requirments.

* Delivery Times
* Small Business Regulation
* Notices regarding Shipping Costs and Taxes
* Base Prices
* Short Cart Product Descriptions 
* Notices regarding Terms and Revocation
* Compatibility with Button Solution
* Double Opt In for Customers
* Tax Calculation for Shipping Costs and Fees
* Terms, Revocation etc. in certain Email Templates
* Payment Gateway: SEPA direct debit
* Payment Gateway: Pay by Invoice
* Payment Gateway Fees
* Online Revocation Form
* Sale Price Labels

= Certified by Trusted Shops =
WooCommerce Germanized has been approved by Trusted Shops and therefor offers best technical conditions to operate a legally certain Online Shop in Germany. 
Trusted Shops certifies Shops after selected and weighted criteria and has carefully examined this WooCommerce Plugin. 
Of course Trusted Shops customers may embed their quality seals or further Trusted Shops Products as genuine Seller and Product Reviews by adapting just a few options within WooCommerce Germanized.

= Properly Implemented =
While developing WC Germanized we have specifically considered clean integration within WooCommerce and WordPress by adapting core functionality.
Most of the changes are made by using Hooks & Filters so that Germanized is compatible to almost every Theme.

= SEPA Direct Debit & Pay By Invoice for WooCommerce = 
With WooCommerce Germanized 1.4 you may offer Pay by Direct Debit and Pay By Invoice to your customers.
Using SEPA Direct Debit checkout fields for IBAN, BIC and Account Holder will be automatically added and verified during checkout.
Furthermore the customer may preview his SEPA Mandate before submitting the order. Starting with 1.6 shop managers may easily export
SEPA Mandates in XML format to import mandates to their house bank our banking software. 
Pay By Invoice may be optionally restricted to regular customers only.

= Pro: WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips = 
As a Pro User of WC Germanized you may automatically or manually create PDF Invoices and Packing Slips for your orders. Doing so you may customize the PDF layout to meet your Corporate Design.
You may upload your head of a letter which will be used as background for your PDF's. With only a few clicks you may export (CSV, zip) invoices for your tax consultant or accountant.
Learn more about [PDF Invoices for WooCommerce](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized#accounting "WooCommerce PDF Invoices")

New: Attach legally relevant Pages (e.g. Terms & Conditions) as PDF documents to specific WooCommerce Emails.

= Tax Calculation for Shipping Costs and Fees =
WooCommerce Germanized supports complicated calculation of shipping/fee taxes for "mixed" shopping carts (that is: cart contains multiple tax rates e.g. 7% and 19%).
In that case tax has to be calculated proportional (based on tax rate share in comparison to total amount).

= Pro: Theme Support =
Professional Users benefit from specific Support of popular Themes. For those Themes we make sure that WooCommerce Germanized Options are visible and visually appealing.
At the moment professional version supports the following Themes: 

* Enfold
* Flatsome
* Storefront
* Virtue

= Pro: Premium Support =
Customers of WC Germanized Pro enjoy our qualified Germanized Support via Tickets. Of course we also seek to offer a good Plugin Support via WordPress Support Forums.

= Double Opt In for WooCommerce =
A new judgement of a German Court makes Shop Managers nervous about whether Double Opt In is required for Online Shops. Therefor WC Germanized offers Double Opt In Support for WooCommerce.
After creating an account the customer receives an activation link via Email. Inactive customers may be automatically deleted after a certain amount of time.
Starting with version 1.6 one may deactivate the checkout for inactive customers. To make this possible, registration has to be separated from the checkout - of course customers may still checkout as guests (if enabled).

= Pro: Conclusion of Contract = 
By default WooCommerce does not offer a distinction between receiving and confirming the order. WooCommerce Germanized Pro offers a feature to manually examine orders before confirming them to the customer.
Shop managers may check order details and then manually confirm the order through a Button in the WooCommerce Backend.

= eKomi Integration =
Shop managers who are using eKomi as a Review Management Service may easily integrate it's features within WooCommerce. 
Easily set up eKomi by adapting a few Settings within WooCommerce Germanized.

== Installation ==

= Minimal Requirments =

* WordPress 3.8 or newer
* WooCommerce 2.4 (newest version recommended)
* PHP Version 5.2.4 or newer

= Automatic Installation =

We recommend installing WooCommerce Germanized through the WordPress Backend. Please install WooCommerce before installing WC Germanized.
After the installation you may easily adapt the settings to your own needs. 

= Shortcodes =

`[revocation_form]`
Inserts online revocation form. Customer and shop manager receive a confirmation by Email.

`[payment_methods_info]`
Very useful for Payment Gateway Information Page - Inserts an overview of all enabled payment gateways plus their descriptions.

`[gzd_complaints]`
Inserts a text that informs the customer about the EU Online Dispute Platform - this Shortcode should be inserted within your imprint. Find more information [here](http://shop.trustedshops.com/de/rechtstipps/jetzt-handeln-link-auf-eu-online-schlichtungs-plattform-ab-9.1.2016).

`[trusted_shops_badge]`
If you are a Trusted Shops Customer, you may insert this Shortcode to insert the Trusted Shops Badge at your favourite place.
With the parameter width=55 (55 means 55px width/height) you may optionally set badge's width.

`[trusted_shops_rich_snippets]`
If you are using Trusted Shop's review functionality, you may insert a Google Rich Snippet about your current shop rating.

= Updating =

Before updating WooCommerce you should definitely check whether WooCommerce Germanized does already support the newest version. 
You may of course Update WooCommerce Germanized automatically through the WordPess Backend. Please make sure to always backup (at least your database) before updating any theme or plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I receive support for WooCommerce Germanized? =

You may ask your questions regarding Germanized within our free [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-germanized).
Professional Support via Ticket is being offered to [Professional Users](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized "Support for WooCommerce Germanized") only.

= Not every option fits my Theme =

Unfortunately not every Theme does implement WooCommerce in the way it's meant to be or differs from the original structure which leads to layout and/or compatibility 
issues. Out of that reason we have developed [VendiPro](https://vendidero.de/vendipro) which perfectly fits all Germanized Options and is optimized for German Market.

= Want to file a Bug or improve Germanized? =

Bug reports may be filed via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vendidero/woocommerce-germanized).
